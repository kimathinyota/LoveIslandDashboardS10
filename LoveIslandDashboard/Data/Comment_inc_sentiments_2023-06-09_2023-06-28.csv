Mitch is down bad, I still feel he‚Äôs genuine though. Tyrique & Ella have major potential to work, she can possibly humble him a bit, I actually love Tyrique the most he‚Äôs going to be chaotic. Zach is boring af but he‚Äôs sooooo nice to look at ü•µ Andre is boring af also, he‚Äôs not really giving away much.

- Mitch is clingy and slightly pretentious, but he has a right to have his own experience the way he feels works for him, so what he told Molly is completely valid. I caught a comment from him that annoyed me though: when someone mentioned molly talking to another dude after he asked where she is, he said ‚Äútypical‚Äù. Childish for a guy who claims to be older and mature.

- Jess is used to being wanted (understandably!) so now that there‚Äôs no guy for her yet, she‚Äôs panicking, and her coping mechanism is leaning into this subtle pick me girl energy. Example: calling molly a game player.

- Whitney had more chemistry with George than Mahdi. Madhi and her give me friends energy more, but ok, that‚Äôs just the vibe that I personally got.

- Molly crying twice in 48 hours on camera made me dislike her more, though I generally do find her interesting and entertaining.

- Sammy is a creep. I don‚Äôt think i even gotta explain this one.

- Zach and Catherine are getting a weird edit, and by that i mean no edit at all. We don‚Äôt see the actual chemistry with them because the producers are pushing this Zach-Molly-whoever else uncertainty.

- Catherine is the most interesting to me so far. Second fav is Whitney. If we ignore everything outside of the villa, I actually did find George fun too.

- I know a lot of people like Ella but I just don‚Äôt see it. I don‚Äôt find her interesting so far, though she gets fair screen time.

- everyone else is meh.",49,t3_145gqdu,1687522563

The lack of honesty is so bizzare because it's so early days and there's no real need for massive loyalty when you can just be honest that you're attracted to someone else and you want a chance to explore that. Tyrique for me is the straight shooter that I want to see. Ella will get hurt feelings at some point but at least she knows where she stands and won't be  blindsided when Tyrique chooses to explore. Zach did all that talk today to everyone else about what he wants but couldn't be real with Catherine. Meanwhile Molly must have amnesia about the show being filmed cos she keeps saying different versions of her interest in Zach to different people. Atp both of them are dragging it so I hope the new bombshells take centre stage and we leave them chatting in the background until recoupling where Zach can pick Molly.,28,t3_1475a1o,1687527276

I say this from a parent pov, we know our children and even though they were polite about Zach, the compliments were on the physical side and even they acknowledged that the attention is nice for Molly from Zach however Mitchel's personality will continue to be the draw if he settles down. And with the addition of other girls we could see Molly get the green eyed monster and suddenly stake her claim on Mitchel if she sees competition and he's no longer head over heels.

And if wants to get to the final or win he needs to play the game better. Even Toby another player got that by the end. In a relationship you can‚Äôt flirt with girls you can‚Äôt ask girls to twirl for you, like that‚Äôs not how relationships work. Being honest about who he is not a law it‚Äôs a character and some of that character is a character flaw. Ella needs to leave",38,t3_149j2k2,1687518884

4- I actually prefer sammie to zach, he has that slimy energy but it‚Äôs LI who doesn‚Äôt. at least he has a personality and was putting on mad moves at the balloon games. I see more potential to him than zero eye contact zach

Snogging zach, getting annoyed that he was helping charlotte out in the gym and trying to insert herself in so he's not alone with her. Now when Mitch acted like this towards Molly she had a problem with it because she's not closed off and is allowed to get to know other people but when the guy she really likes goes and does it, she gets annoyed?

* I love seeing Molly squirm and realize that she may no longer be the hot commodity. I don't dislike the girl but I just don't get her either. Fine if she felt Mitch was moving too fast - he was coming on strong, but the way she went about the Zac situation was snakey and it seems like all her and Zac can talk about is how they're open to talking to each other, but not actually saying anything of substance. I don't see them as a good personality fit and I just think Molly likes the attention, especially seeing her kind of freak out when Mitch was flirting with the bombshells. All fun and games when you have all the cards, but not nice when it happens the other way.
* Mitch - I want to like him, and I feel for him in the fact that he got really in his feels very quickly, but he's just coming off as emotionally immature. Like dude has no chill - even if Leah is his type, it's like he's bouncing off the walls freaking out - he can't keep anything close to his chest and it's a bit unappealing. Still, I feel like he wasn't treated totally right by Molly and he deserved more honest communication from her.  He doesn't have malicious intent. I think he was right when he said to Molly she wants to have her cake and eat it too.
* It looks like the next episode is when some of the Tyrique/Ella stuff is going to blow - and I think we all saw this coming. The one thing about Tyrique is he's been open to Ella about getting to know someone else, I just think Ella is ignoring the signs and is going to freak out when the inevitable happens. I also didn't realize how attached Ella was to him - she looked like she was fuming on the terrace. I honestly don't mind Tyrique- def would not want to be in a relationship with him but he's fun vibes and drama and imo he's not being snakey about it.
* I think Jess will be good for gossip/shit talk this season and so far I'm agreeing with her takes. I definitely think her initial dislike of Molly came from jealousy, but I also think she sees her shifty movements and is clocking them. I want Jess to find a guy because I think Sammy is only into her out of convenience. She reminds me a little of S6 Jess.
* Zac is so boring and I think Catherine can do SO much better. I really don't see his appeal? He's hot but idk, not hot enough for me to get over his lack of personality.
* Overall this season is starting out pretty well! Good drama, almost all of the islanders have likable aspects to them and things seem authentic and not petty.",34,t3_1495whv,1687535068

Jess crying was her being dramatic imo, she said so herself. Yes she might not of liked being asked why she didn't pick Molly and it overwhelmed her to feel like she had to explain herself but it wasn't confrontational and they were asking in response to her whispering with Mitch, in front of them that it should've been Molly. Mitch and Jess could've saved that opinion for later.  It wasn't that deep anyway which is why it had barely any airtime.

Mehdi didn't disrespect Whitney that much or is now ""disgusting"" and a disappointment, he just mismanaged approaching the situation. In the heat of the moment he saw Jess upset, jumped to the wrong conclusion to defend and wrongly assumed Whitney and Catherine were coming at her from a place of malice. He should've asked and listened or allow the girls to sort it out between themselves without getting involved. Some things aren't the whole villa's business and speaking as a woman we have tiffs and bicker over so many little things, numerous times a day and they don't require a referee or post mortem. It was a simple case of miscommunication that got sorted with an apology.

I think people are too quick to react and write islanders off just because they don't handle situations the way they would. Everything is a day or a few days drama, most won't even be holding grudges and none of them will be scarred for life because they had a disagreement. I mean Molly spent the day sitting and laughing with her ""stalker"" and shared a bed you can't get more unfazed than that lol.",28,t3_14adclp,1687520948

* Mitch is just setting himself up for disaster. I'm sure Molly appreciated it since now she's safe, but he's so hot and cold and emotionally immature. One sec being upset, the next obsessing. Mans needs to calm down and put things in perspective. I think he has good intentions but like- there are other attractive people in this world aside from Molly.
* At the same time Molly just needs to be straight up. For example: ""look, I don't see this going anywhere - your recent antics have turned me off."" I feel like she's happy to benefit from his doting but then she loves making out with Zac. Anyway, it seems like she'll still like Mitch  (I think it's reasonable for her to no longer like him due to his clingy and emotional behavior) but it's like girl needs to perpetually keep her options open. Like vibing with someone and being honest doesn't mean you're marrying the person. I think she just likes the attention and doesn't want to get deep with anyone.
* Glad Tyrique and Zac were taken by the bombshells to spice things up. Ella looked so shook! And I feel for her, she definitely was into Tyrique wayyy more than she should have let herself get - and we all clocked it that he was going to be a player. He was fairly honest about it too. Still, I get her feeling like she was comfortable to being definitely not.
* Still not a fan of Zac, but love to see some drama shake up the Molly/Zac dynamic. They seem to be the two hottest commodities and I wouldn't mind seeing them be a little humbled since both have moved a bit snake-like
* Poor Ruchee, I like her, but she's definitely not vibing romantically with anyone and I think she's the goner. She seems sweet but I also don't know if her personality is the best for the love island vibe?
* I don't really see it romantically between Mehdi and Whitney, (and idk if they see it either with their insistence to take things slow) but I think they are so fun as a friend couple!",11,t3_1495yw0,1687535037

Also, Molly was aware she was being bullied, and if no one else says anything it would feel like they must all agree. I think Whitney and Catherine were peacekeeping, and Jess over-reacted.

I knew they weren't going to pick Zach and Sammy since Jess + Molly were the main deciders. Although there are people that are more likable than others, I don't think anyone is a true villain and a lot are bringing chaos to the table so I think this will be a season where maybe you won't be able to skate by if you're low-drama/low-impact. In other seasons there can be obvious villains that people don't like and want to get rid of, but this season those are more Mitch and Ty, who both bring craziness to the villa without being totally hatable so I think the public will keep them around as long as they keep feeding the drama.

I thought the guys could have done something a little shocking and dumped Catherine, although I think they made the right choice. As much as I like older representation, Charlotte seemed to be on a totally different wavelength and that doesn't work when most of the cast is young and not really at the stage to start looking for a family.

I'm surprised that Sammy seems to be into Jess? I was thinking he was using her but who knows if he's just saying what she wants to hear.

I think the public did a good job with the voting - glad to see Zach and Sammy down in the bottom 3. Team chaos!",8,t3_14b80ks,1687519843

They both seem like nice girls, but I think for bombshells you need someone a bit more fiery to shake things up. I find that when bombshells come in and they're trying to be nice, do things by the book and not step on toes they don't do as well. 

Charlotte was just on a totally different wavelength than everyone else, and Leah seems super nice but a little dry (at least on reality TV.) Scott is attractive but again, doesn't have that 'i'm going to get what I want' vibe which is why he's not really making as much of a splash.

Whitney and catherine clearly dislike molly too and were hopeful jess would be the one messy enough to announce it but were making it like it‚Äôs jess not being authentic enough.

Lastly, I do feel for Molly.  She‚Äôs not my favourite girl by any means but that Mitch has some worrying behaviour that he shows mostly with Molly alone.

- What is the actual stance on sexual activity? I know that in early seasons it was fairly common for islanders to fuck in the shared bedroom, has that explicitly been forbidden since or have all islanders just come to their senses that it's a bad move for national TV?",7,t3_14dbblo,1687528662

There seems to be a lot of sexual and social pedestalising within the villa.

Easy examples:

‚Ä¢ **The tallest guy is with the shortest girl in the villa - Zack and Molly**

‚Ä¢ **Funniest guys either get immediately friendzoned or pedestalised - no in-between. George immediately friendzoned, and then now Mitch**

‚Ä¢ **Most if not all of the guys the girls have been with have been pedestalised or made to be at the centre of attention:**

First - Mitch, by Molly, Jess and the rest of the girls (now friendzoned) 

Second - Zack, by Katherine, Molly, Leah, and Charlotte 

Third - Tyriech, by Ella, Jess, Leah 

Fourth - Sammy, by Leah, and Jess 

Mehedi kind of friendzoned by the girls.

‚Ä¢ **Rejecting a guy/girl Infront of others seems incredibly attractive to people.**",4,t3_14dbblo,1687528662

here you‚Äôre not allowed to have an opinion on one incident, to critique or comment on one thing, without it being taken as your final opinion on that islander, and also as a judgment on you as a whole.

to hold even just one opinion on one situation, it obviously means you hate an islander, or you‚Äôre racist, or you don‚Äôt take misogyny seriously, or you‚Äôre fine with all the bad things an islander has said and done etc etc. 

its all so extravagant, theres no such thing as just having a simple opinion. people used to comment really frivolously here and just make jokes and have a laugh, and didn‚Äôt have to worry about making a thousand disclaimers in order to not get jumped all over lol",17,t3_14dbblo,1687528662

Sami should of told Leah the night before that he was feeling Jess and that‚Äôs on him, but with the quick re couple he didn‚Äôt get a chance to get his conversation with her. Did he act disrespectful, yes, but he was frustrated that people were saying things behind his back to Jess and Leah, and him losing his cool and starting to talk crazy did not help. I think he had the right idea, but executed poorly, honestly girls like Ella butting in and sparking drama before anyone in the situation can talk about it directly, is not cool.

1. Sammy is a slimeball with a majorly outsized ego and clearly feels aggrieved that in his own mind he's out of Jess' league and she isn't acting grateful enough to be with him. He loved having two girls to choose between and now he's panicking because Jess isn't as much of a melt for him as he expected.

2. Jess is a drama llama who looks for any reason to pick a fight. His reaction to her getting to know Mitch in that conversation was actually totally normal - he said she could get to know him and that was fine, he just wouldn't wait around forever, which is what they all say. He also had a point that if he acted like he didn't care at all she'd be mad too. I don't think he could have had any reaction that she wouldn't have kicked off about.

Overall they're both exhausting at this point and I'm glad they can't recouple. Hopefully Sammy is gone next dumping, I found their turbulence entertaining but it's run its course and the way he talks about/to women is gross.",52,t3_14ez5sy,1687528563

Mehdi and Whitney I love, they are growing on me. Whitney is also gorgeous, she looks like Naomi Campbell.

Love molly and zak together, finally. Molly is a bad bitch for the way she dealt with psycho Mitch lol. Jess was annoying with her jealous comments but she‚Äôs harmless overall. Zak is so fucking fine my GODDDDDDDDD. Wow. He‚Äôs def better looking than molly to me personally. 

Mitch‚Ä¶ yeah psycho. Waiting for him to be dumped.

Jess and Sammy i was rooting for them‚Ä¶ now idk what i think and don‚Äôt want to form an opinion until i see this new upcoming drama.

Leah is a cute girl, curious to see if her and Scott go anywhere. Scott seems more interested in her than Catherine based on the sexual tension comments he made, and him stating he‚Äôs leaning more towards Leah when Catherine asked. Scott is gorgeous. Leah is super super sweet and endearing. Catherine is super mature and beautiful. I love her personality. Love the way she handles thing, very mature just like Molly.

Ty and Ella, Ella‚Äôs body is just wow! Ty is one of the hottest guys ever to be in the villa along with Zakeriah. Top two hottest this season for sure. Ella was so annoying when he was getting to know Leah, sorry but she was too much. I do find their bickering funny and cute sometimes though. Overall i like them together. I just don‚Äôt know if Ty would behave not just in casa amor but outside of the show‚Ä¶ he seems like a huge player and flirt for sure. But u rly can‚Äôt be mad at him with that face. My God he‚Äôs beautiful. 

I rly liked ruche. Sad she left. She‚Äôs gorg and i love her vibe. Charolette was nice but she didn‚Äôt fit into love island vibes, she needs someone much more mature. Andre was cool, i wanted him to stay for Catherine bc i feel like he was the only one that was ride or die for Catherine. The fact he wanted her the second she was available again even though he started something with ruche. I felt bad for ruche but it showed how much he rly felt towards Catherine. :/ 

George was almost non existent obv as first to go and barely any screen time or connections made but he wasn‚Äôt as bad as i thought he would be, just a little awkward sometimes. Shame about those rumors about him bc he‚Äôs good looking if u look past the cringe comments he makes sometimes but he took me by surprise in his after sun interview. He wasn‚Äôt as awkward during that. Very well spoken.",2,t3_14ez5sy,1687528563

* Generally I'm team Jess bc I think Sammy is bad vibes, but I think she is doing a poor job of articulating herself. I think she is seeing through him and his clocking his defensiveness but she is calling him on more vague stuff about ""wanting to get to know Mitch"" - I don't see them lasting at all and my take is that Sammy never really liked Jess like that, but coupled with her out of convenience, but now he's mad that she has options. He wants to be a prize. 
* Mehdi and Whitney - my take is that they both like each other in a kind of friendship 'lol' way but Idk if there is true romantic passion. Everything is jokes (unless Mehdi has a random freakout for no reason) But I don't think they're totally fake- like I think they each want it to work but aren't exactly that into each other physically and personality-wise. Idk we'll see.
* Save Mitch at all costs. Mans is reality TV gold - I'm also enjoying him more because he's simmered down a bit and hasn't been showing his full blown crazy side

They both seem chill and reasonable, gave each other space, and then confirmed their attraction to each other. Good vibes! Who knows if it will last but idk it's the first couple I'm really rooting for this season. I thought Montel and Catherine also had good chemistry. Honestly Scott and Montel are my fave guys as far as who I'd go for if I was in that fish bowl.
* Sammy sucks - I'm definitely team Jess in their argument but I think that Jess does a poor job of articulating herself. I think she recognizes that Sammy's defensiveness and alarming ability to make girls cry are red flags but she reverts back to the 'talking to other people' thing instead of calling out the communication. But at the same time, I think she does still kind of like him and wants it to work so she's not ready to burn the bridge yet.
* I feel bad for Leah but I kind of see why people aren't picking her. I think she's a catch and someone else in this thread mentioned she's really good at first dates but then after there's awkwardness and she doesn't give a lot of light-hearted banter. Everything is more serious and straightforward which I think makes it difficult to the guys to relate and vibe with her. Even Montel was asking about her 'real personality' so I think it's coming across to them that although she's stunning, smart, has a head on her shoulders, she's missing that levity and banter that they may be looking for. She just seems reserved and closed off. Still, I'm rooting for Montel and Leah as their first date was the first time on this show that I saw an initial vibe.
* I hope some serious drama comes from the Zach cheating issues next episode - I need something to shake up that couple because I think they're just together out of convenience/lust and not because they're really compatible long term
* LMAO Mitch - my delusional king. Now don't kill me, but I think generally the islanders clock his weirdness and I think he's mellowed out now that he understands his situation in the villa. I think he and the others can banter more since it's like they're all in on it. Idk I felt like there was a smidge of self-awareness with the Jess/Mitch convo. Like he's still light-hearted with his delusions.

Time and time again during show I‚Äôve seen on social media that whenever a white man is coupled up with a black woman people are always so confused as to what that guy could‚Äôve seen with his partner to make him attracted to her. 

Sammy is arguing that he didn‚Äôt see the physical attraction between Scott and Catharine and Whitney and Mehdi. Wasn‚Äôt Catharine the first person Scott pulled aside when he got into the villa? Do we not see them cuddling all the time? Didn‚Äôt Whitney and mehdi just have their first kiss in the episode prior? 
In my opinion I don‚Äôt think Sammy is accepting of an interracial couple. 

It‚Äôs just so sad that when it comes to the black girls on this show, their physical appearance is degraded to the point where people are shocked that a white guy could be attracted to them and this is such sad thing to witness. Just going on the love island into the alone under Scott‚Äôs bombshell pic I saw so many comments saying stuff like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs going to Catherine when Leah and Molly are right there‚Äù‚Ä¶ why are comments like this so common???

What really got me was when Catherine was trying to get her point across about how his opinion on the physical attraction comment really affected her and he didn‚Äôt give her any time to talk which let her cry out of frustration.

Of course cheating is pretty damn heinous, but there's been *loads* of islanders who have admitted to cheating and the reaction has rarely been anything other than their respective partner being suspicious...idk it's just never been a huge deal on Love Island.

If you don't like someone that everyone else does and you don't get the hype just say so, or if you changed your mind throughout the season that's ok. We all watch the show with our own eyes and minds to form our own opinions. It's fair to dislike them for how they've acted in situations or their personality in general but to use their fanbase's ""worship"" of them or their ott theories of ""everyone is against them"" as a reason of why you're ""starting"" to dislike them is silly to me when they have no connection to their fans while they're in the villa.

It's different if they come out being shady and encouraging their fans to be nasty to others but until then say who you don't like and why with your full chest. I know some people don't like to voice unpopular opinions because of the backlash and downvoting but it is supposed to be freedom of speech so we shouldn't be afraid to have our say even if it goes against the grain. And if people don't wanna have healthy debates of disagreement and just wanna be rude I suggest blocking or deleting the comment/post if people refuse to be civil and can't give an actual pov without insults, don't bother fighting back and forth giving yourself a headache like these strangers on a tv show are paying you.

Just a thought...I've been seeing some people complaining about fanbases and it bought me back to S8 and how I too was sucked into the illusion of the fans are the reason I don't like them when the truth was I didn't like them anyway. I think as long as there's no personal attacks on the person you can dislike some islanders without having to explain yourself... you just never took to them.",5,t3_14fv8r5,1687528574

I know both Catherine and Leah are now getting to know someone else other than Scott too and everyone seems to be fine about it; but still it was a bit weird to talk to Leah and kind of sell her a dream that they could still become a thing and then immediately go to Catherine and kiss her. He was handling the whole situation so good and now I‚Äôm worried it might get a bit messy. 
#
I was a huge fan of Jess from the beginning but she was a bit icky last night üò¨ The thing is she really likes Sammy and wanted to use the Leah situation to keep him on his toes but dragged it for way too long and it backfired. She has no one to blame but herself and the way she was nagging and crying over those votes was so childish. The way she was hugging Ella the next morning and talking about the situation like a little child talking about their schoolmates was sooooo icky. And now she is forcing herself to see something more than friendship with Mitch which I think won‚Äôt happen and Sammy will still be her number 1 till the last moment they‚Äôre in the villa.
#
I enjoy watching Mitch‚Äôs weird actions but I can‚Äôt help but thinking that he is such a game player. He was so desperate to become that strong first-day couple aka the mom and dad of the villa with Molly that he pushed her away. Then he went for Jess because he didn‚Äôt have any other option and now that he knows both of them are fan favorites, he is trying so hard to couple up with her to have a chance to win this season.

What he said about Catherine caused her to react because POC women on this show have a hard time. If they aren‚Äôt coupled up with the other POC, they are usually not an option for the majority. Catherine is a darker skinned, stunning black girl who lives in Dublin. It‚Äôs a very white City sans tourists and I can easily imagine (just like a lot of girls I know) that although she is stunning, she may not have it as easy as her white counterpart to be taken seriously as a dating/relationship option.

Sammie throwing out, he doesn‚Äôt see the attraction there with her (but does with Leah) very likely played into insecurities she has due to that constant feeling of not being seen in the same light and it‚Äôs sad AF. Sammie may not have known the impact of what he said but his double down and then ‚Äòapology‚Äô (producers probably) just shows he‚Äôs crap.

Scott was torn between Leah and Catherine but Catherine's communication skills made his decision easier for him. Zach hasn't turned his head since he got with Molly.

No reaction is the best reaction. It really rubbed me the wrong way when he said 'Leah speaks well'. Does Leah speak at all? And it's very obvious Whitney masks her feelings and nerves with humour.

The girls were in the wrong for attacking Zach but Molly should be concerned about his 'I can't wait to find a girl I don't want to cheat on' comment. He can just choose to be single?

Tyrique has become my favourite islander. The way he respectfully told Ella she was wrong but still had her back in public put him in my good books! I think they'll last for a very long time after the show.

How do the islanders stomach Mitch's presence? He always has an opinion but was calling out Ella for beign too 'opinionated'? Jess was as equally responsible yet he said nothing to her because she's his ticket to stay in the villa.

I feel bad for Leah, just used as practise for flirting by these boys.

Molly gets too much hate. People complain about her 'doing too much' but it's literally the personality of every theatre kid. And if she was trying to act more cool, she would still get hate for 'putting on an act'?

You can tell Jess has no interest in Mitch and only likes Sammy, hence the crying when seeing him with Mal. She clearly only spoke to Mitch to put Sammy on his toes and it backfired horribly. And that's the exact reason why her and Sammy will never work. They have no communication whatsoever. (and he also degrades her in private)",48,t3_14gstlo,1687684713

I rate Tyrique for standing up for Ella but why is he coming for Mitch that way when he‚Äôs the biggest shit stirrer in there himself.

Jess is honestly just a mean girl to Molly. I don‚Äôt get why. 

Ella is pretty delusional cuz how does she care about cheating so much but she‚Äôs with Ty (Mr 100 bodies.) Sorry but huge red flag there.

I like Leah but either they‚Äôre not showing her personality or she doesn‚Äôt have one. 

I like Catherine/Scott but I thought she had a lot more chemistry with Montel. 

Get Sammy off my screen please. Sorry Mal I feel like I might like you but she‚Äôs prob collateral damage. 

Idk how to feel about Mitch. He‚Äôs treated as the village idiot so I kind of feel bad for him but not really cuz the man is unhinged. 

Zach & Molly do like each other but they‚Äôre boring. Still I think her & Zach & Catherine & Scott have the most potential. 

Mehdi why? I don‚Äôt understand but whatever Whitney deserves more anyways! I want her to make it to Casa.

I can't help thinking about the first weeks and how much hate she received when people believed she was a producer plant and getting the most airtime. It will be so unpleasant to see people come for her even more savage if they see this as favouritism as Kady will have told the producers she was choosing Zach therefore people may accuse the show of only putting the twist in because it's Molly but wouldn't have done it for someone else. Even though there would be no way to prove that it's true, people's mixed feelings of Molly could bring more hate towards her and make people think that her storyline going forward is predetermined.

Even though this has been done before in other versions I'm not sure if they were a person that the public had preconceived ideas about and judged as harshly as a ""producer plant or favourite"" as Molly was. Selfishly I want her to come back because her relationship with Zach is most intriguing to me to see play out however I'd understand her not returning as the viewers hate has gotten more worse over the years and could impact her mental health more if there's a huge backlash.

I think people will get over her not being there eventually more than her being there. Last season everyone was convinced that Zara wouldn't be dumped because she bought the drama and was too popular to get rid of or would be bought back, she wasn't.

That comment gave me war flashbacks to myself at 21 when I dated a 26yr who explicitly told me he broke up with his gf of *six* years by cheating on her first and then telling her he was moving for a nonexistent job (like Chandler on Friends pretending to move to YemenüíÄ). There I was all ‚Äúüòäthat‚Äôs okay because he was honest which means he‚Äôs grown from it and he won‚Äôt do that to *me*. He makes me feel so calm and safe and like I‚Äôve known him my entire life.‚Äù You can guess how that ended lmaoooo

Then really if you think of this past week Zach said his head couldn‚Äôt be turned in that game, reiterated to her he hoped it couldn‚Äôt be turned in their discussion about said game, went on a date and Molly talked about being more and more closed and him reassuring that. Her telling him he‚Äôs her safe space and him *loving* that, only for him to proclaim Kady is *his type* to the boys and then come to her after he‚Äôs talked to Kady once and say essentially ‚Äúyeah if anyone comes in you should get to know them for sure‚Äù and her proclaiming they‚Äôre still on the same pageüò¨

Originally I thought bringing Molly back would be fun and someone mentioned doing it in the heart race challenge which sounded epic!

Then I saw this post

And now I‚Äôm fully in the Molly should not return crowd. If she comes back I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go well for her and we will all have to witness her learning for the first time the life lesson Danica reminded us of last season of ‚Äúall men are trash‚Äù that every girl goes through at some point in their life, which feels cruel to watch? At least with her leaving it‚Äôs a mercy kill and she can learn it while crying with her mom instead of on our TVs?

I like drama but I‚Äôm not that cruel and heartless omg

I expect we see Zach‚Äôs second Villian Arc beginning Sunday (or I guess he could surprise us and pine after Molly because now she‚Äôs forbidden fruit from being eliminated, but I think it‚Äôs most likely the former).",19,t3_14hrpnq,1687807142

We don‚Äôt know what is going to happen but from a veterans watcher just take it as it comes and be prepared for the unexpected. Because storylines are never set in stone until the final ends.,44,t3_14hrpnq,1687807142

 I'm probably going to keep up with memes but I'm not gonna be actually watching it anymore.
The show is still called ""Love"" Island but what's the point of trying to get invested in couples if they can just remove all agency from the islanders *and* the public vote and just dump people from established couples? 

If she had been voted bottom in the public or islanders had voted her lowest compatibility like they did in previous seasons, or Zach had to make a choice and chose Kady. I'd have no issue but a former islander coming back and kicking someone out is just not my vibe. Kady shouldn't need extreme producer interference to bombshell. Molly and Zach had been in a couple for only 5 days and yeah they weren't mega exciting but I want to see how a couples journey actually unfolds and dealt with challenges and bombshells, not have producer interference cut it short and remove any agency from them.

Edit: Also bringing her back wouldn't even be that dramatic now because her and Zach were still early days so as stupid as Zach is he shouldn't be expected to leave with her... nor to have an insane reaction if she comes back, everything was just cut short.",11,t3_14ijsca,1687937107

I get that Jess was with Sammy and Molly was with Zach but both of those couples are gone now. Jess and Sammy lasted like 2 or 3 days after that dumping and now Molly's gone.

As much as I liked Whitney and Medhis slow burn thing, in my opinion he's not right for her. She has such a big and loud personality and he seems like he doesn't like that and tries to dial it down. She deserves someone who matches her energy and doesn't constantly start arguments.

I think Ty really likes Ella but he's just so used to being a player he doesn't want to commit. He's scared. On the other hand he's also a hypocrite.

First of all, who the fuck is ‚Äúwe‚Äù? How anyone thinks that it‚Äôs ok to so openly speculate about someone‚Äôs sexual orientation, I will never understand. We saw it with Curtis S5, Will S9, and now with Mehdi. It‚Äôs disheartening to see how casually people talk about him being too ‚Äúsassy‚Äù, Whitney needing a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù etc.

I don't get what everyone is seeing but with Scott, I see that she is a cool, calm and confident young woman who's going with the flow and enjoying his attention and looks on the bright side of the cards she's been given with a ""let's see how it goes"" vibe. I wish people would appreciate how Catherine is participating with a mature approach, not stressing and give her the grace like the old days with similar characters who also struggled to form connections straight away without these insufferable pity opinions like she's a besotted fool, declaring her undying love for Scott and picturing her wedding day.

I've seen nothing at the moment that suggests Catherine is heading for heartbreak (as in she'll hugely be devastated) as she's been encouraging Scott in the process of getting know multiple people while she does the same. It won't surprise me to see her take full advantage at casa amor and embrace the opportunity to get to know new guys. I can also see her and Scott doing a Dami and Indiyah where they discuss before casa amor the option of bringing people back but still getting to know each other at the same time. Or they could both fall ""head over heels"" for other people. Who knows but I don't think the pity party opinions are needed at this stage.

Sidebar: Molly looked great on LI Aftersun. I look forward to seeing what she has planned for her future and I hope she knocks this ""waiting for Zach"" on the head for now and concentrates on herself. I'm not so sure anymore if Zach will be genuine with her on the outside. I don't want him thinking he can stay in and crack on with others girls but come out and try to get with Molly for the ""true love"" reunion story. That will disappoint me, it's his journey he can do what he wants but I hope he leaves ""thoughts"" of Molly out of it if he's fully moving on.",58,t3_14ix943,1687934025

* Zach - honestly his reaction to rejection made me like him a smidge more. He's not used to it but handled it well. I think my issue with him is that he's too guarded and chill - feels like things are a front - like he always wants to be seen as a levelheaded, unemotional, cool guy but in the process comes off like he has a wall up. Kinda fits that he moved on so quickly after Molly-  I don't think he really let himself actually get feelings for her, which is why I think a lot of people aren't rooting for him - it's hard to envision him in a believable couple and actually falling for someone in the end. But also I do think Kady makes more sense for him than Molly did. 
* Lol Mitch - Mitch and Scott are my favorite boys. Mitch for the shenanigans and Scott bc he's probably the guy I'd most likely go for in there.
* Mehdi- I just feel like he needs to go and it's frustrating how him and Whitney go around in circles when it's a clear mis-matched relationship. Couldn't stand how he said how Whitney was ""upset"" or something when she was perfectly calm and logical. 
* Leah and Montel - I like them as a nice vanilla couple who are both low key. I don't really see being obsessed with them at the end but I think they're cute.",59,t3_14jt7iy,1687934395

This is the first season my favourite islander is also the favourite of a LOT of the viewers... King Whitney. 

The second she entered I was enthralled and she just keeps on giving and giving. She's intelligent, witty, empathetic, fun, candid etc. 

She deserves all the support, all of the flowers. 

Medhi was a fav too cuz to me he's the best looking man there (if I avoid looking directly into Tys magical yet dangerous eyes), but he's clearly not a nice person, possibly racist, and I regret my support of him. 

Also, I think Medhi kissed the girls to try to raise heart rates as he couldn't dance (he said this in beach hut) but FOR SOME DUMB REASON instead of being honest about WHY, and being vulnerable with it, he's come across way worse. If he'd said ""I can't dance and the challenge was out of my comfort zone and I reacted to that in the wrong way"" he's letting ego and pride ruin him. 

But, YAY WITNEY",39,t3_14jt7iy,1687934395

Kady is an absolutely pointless addition but don't see there being any decline by Molly not being there either, she really was a non-entity. 

Tyrique is just convincing himself he's closed off, the lady doth protest too much.

Medhi regained a little with how he handled being dumped but it was the right thing, mostly for Whitney who I feel really sorry for.

Mitch needs a girl genuinely into him in Casa just so he gets a chance and we have the potential for him to go super crazy again or actually experience the show fully.

Casa is going to do Whitney well. She may be able to win this show because people just like her. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs going to be about the couple itself‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôs gonna take the moneys hahah 

Zach is actually the most brainless idiot, when he speaks it bores me. Never anything even slightly intelligent to say 

Ella is too far gone. Even if Casa doesn‚Äôt destroy her and Tyrique, he‚Äôs going to pie her off the second they exit that villa. Poor girl but she‚Äôs actually dim and needs to learn self respect at this point. 

I wonder if Catherine and Scott know they actually may be able to win. The public is falling for them, and loving the slow burn. I don‚Äôt know if they radiate that much chemistry but they‚Äôre trying to make it work as far as I can tell.
