Mitch is down bad, I still feel he‚Äôs genuine though. Tyrique & Ella have major potential to work, she can possibly humble him a bit, I actually love Tyrique the most he‚Äôs going to be chaotic.

- Mitch is clingy and slightly pretentious, but he has a right to have his own experience the way he feels works for him, so what he told Molly is completely valid. I caught a comment from him that annoyed me though: when someone mentioned molly talking to another dude after he asked where she is, he said ‚Äútypical‚Äù. Childish for a guy who claims to be older and mature.

- Jess is used to being wanted (understandably!) so now that there‚Äôs no guy for her yet, she‚Äôs panicking, and her coping mechanism is leaning into this subtle pick me girl energy. Example: calling molly a game player.

- Whitney had more chemistry with George than Mahdi. Madhi and her give me friends energy more, but ok, that‚Äôs just the vibe that I personally got.

- Molly crying twice in 48 hours on camera made me dislike her more, though I generally do find her interesting and entertaining.

- Sammy is a creep. I don‚Äôt think i even gotta explain this one.

- Zach and Catherine are getting a weird edit, and by that i mean no edit at all. We don‚Äôt see the actual chemistry with them because the producers are pushing this Zach-Molly-whoever else uncertainty.

- Catherine is the most interesting to me so far. Second fav is Whitney. If we ignore everything outside of the villa, I actually did find George fun too.

- I know a lot of people like Ella but I just don‚Äôt see it. I don‚Äôt find her interesting so far, though she gets fair screen time.

- everyone else is meh.",49,t3_145gqdu,1687522563,0.9447

The lack of honesty is so bizzare because it's so early days and there's no real need for massive loyalty when you can just be honest that you're attracted to someone else and you want a chance to explore that. Tyrique for me is the straight shooter that I want to see. Ella will get hurt feelings at some point but at least she knows where she stands and won't be  blindsided when Tyrique chooses to explore. Zach did all that talk today to everyone else about what he wants but couldn't be real with Catherine. Meanwhile Molly must have amnesia about the show being filmed cos she keeps saying different versions of her interest in Zach to different people. Atp both of them are dragging it so I hope the new bombshells take centre stage and we leave them chatting in the background until recoupling where Zach can pick Molly.,28,t3_1475a1o,1687527276,0.9326

Jess is being a pain in the arse but don't demean Molly's strong character by placing her in a victim box when she might be more than capable of making herself heard if she thinks it's worth it to say something to Jess.

I'm confused by Zach. Charlotte gave him the perfect out to be straight up and reject her and he's still saying he's open and it's too early to know for sure. I don't quite understand the issue because he's said up and down, left to right that it's Molly he's most invested in, to the point she's now closed off. So why are you hesitating after you discomposed the harmony of the villa to be with Molly only to stay open with a woman you have no interest in.

* I love seeing Molly squirm and realize that she may no longer be the hot commodity. I don't dislike the girl but I just don't get her either. Fine if she felt Mitch was moving too fast - he was coming on strong, but the way she went about the Zac situation was snakey and it seems like all her and Zac can talk about is how they're open to talking to each other, but not actually saying anything of substance. I don't see them as a good personality fit and I just think Molly likes the attention, especially seeing her kind of freak out when Mitch was flirting with the bombshells. All fun and games when you have all the cards, but not nice when it happens the other way.
* Mitch - I want to like him, and I feel for him in the fact that he got really in his feels very quickly, but he's just coming off as emotionally immature. Like dude has no chill - even if Leah is his type, it's like he's bouncing off the walls freaking out - he can't keep anything close to his chest and it's a bit unappealing. Still, I feel like he wasn't treated totally right by Molly and he deserved more honest communication from her.  He doesn't have malicious intent. I think he was right when he said to Molly she wants to have her cake and eat it too.
* It looks like the next episode is when some of the Tyrique/Ella stuff is going to blow - and I think we all saw this coming. The one thing about Tyrique is he's been open to Ella about getting to know someone else, I just think Ella is ignoring the signs and is going to freak out when the inevitable happens. I also didn't realize how attached Ella was to him - she looked like she was fuming on the terrace. I honestly don't mind Tyrique- def would not want to be in a relationship with him but he's fun vibes and drama and imo he's not being snakey about it.
* I think Jess will be good for gossip/shit talk this season and so far I'm agreeing with her takes. I definitely think her initial dislike of Molly came from jealousy, but I also think she sees her shifty movements and is clocking them. I want Jess to find a guy because I think Sammy is only into her out of convenience. She reminds me a little of S6 Jess.
* Zac is so boring and I think Catherine can do SO much better. I really don't see his appeal? He's hot but idk, not hot enough for me to get over his lack of personality.
* Overall this season is starting out pretty well! Good drama, almost all of the islanders have likable aspects to them and things seem authentic and not petty.",34,t3_1495whv,1687535068,0.9963

Jess crying was her being dramatic imo, she said so herself. Yes she might not of liked being asked why she didn't pick Molly and it overwhelmed her to feel like she had to explain herself but it wasn't confrontational and they were asking in response to her whispering with Mitch, in front of them that it should've been Molly. Mitch and Jess could've saved that opinion for later.  It wasn't that deep anyway which is why it had barely any airtime.

Mehdi didn't disrespect Whitney that much or is now ""disgusting"" and a disappointment, he just mismanaged approaching the situation. In the heat of the moment he saw Jess upset, jumped to the wrong conclusion to defend and wrongly assumed Whitney and Catherine were coming at her from a place of malice. He should've asked and listened or allow the girls to sort it out between themselves without getting involved. Some things aren't the whole villa's business and speaking as a woman we have tiffs and bicker over so many little things, numerous times a day and they don't require a referee or post mortem. It was a simple case of miscommunication that got sorted with an apology.

I think people are too quick to react and write islanders off just because they don't handle situations the way they would. Everything is a day or a few days drama, most won't even be holding grudges and none of them will be scarred for life because they had a disagreement. I mean Molly spent the day sitting and laughing with her ""stalker"" and shared a bed you can't get more unfazed than that lol.",28,t3_14adclp,1687520948,0.7781

* Mitch is just setting himself up for disaster. I'm sure Molly appreciated it since now she's safe, but he's so hot and cold and emotionally immature. One sec being upset, the next obsessing. Mans needs to calm down and put things in perspective. I think he has good intentions but like- there are other attractive people in this world aside from Molly.
* At the same time Molly just needs to be straight up. For example: ""look, I don't see this going anywhere - your recent antics have turned me off."" I feel like she's happy to benefit from his doting but then she loves making out with Zac. Anyway, it seems like she'll still like Mitch  (I think it's reasonable for her to no longer like him due to his clingy and emotional behavior) but it's like girl needs to perpetually keep her options open. Like vibing with someone and being honest doesn't mean you're marrying the person. I think she just likes the attention and doesn't want to get deep with anyone.
* Glad Tyrique and Zac were taken by the bombshells to spice things up. Ella looked so shook! And I feel for her, she definitely was into Tyrique wayyy more than she should have let herself get - and we all clocked it that he was going to be a player. He was fairly honest about it too. Still, I get her feeling like she was comfortable to being definitely not.
* Still not a fan of Zac, but love to see some drama shake up the Molly/Zac dynamic. They seem to be the two hottest commodities and I wouldn't mind seeing them be a little humbled since both have moved a bit snake-like
* Poor Ruchee, I like her, but she's definitely not vibing romantically with anyone and I think she's the goner. She seems sweet but I also don't know if her personality is the best for the love island vibe?
* I don't really see it romantically between Mehdi and Whitney, (and idk if they see it either with their insistence to take things slow) but I think they are so fun as a friend couple!",11,t3_1495yw0,1687535037,0.9989

They all live in such close proximity and Jess was constantly making negative comments to everyone about Molly.

They didn't try to make Jess into the bad guy, they just wanted to let her know she might be seen that way if she didn't tone it down. 
Also, Molly was aware she was being bullied, and if no one else says anything it would feel like they must all agree. I think Whitney and Catherine were peacekeeping, and Jess over-reacted.

In other seasons there can be obvious villains that people don't like and want to get rid of, but this season those are more Mitch and Ty, who both bring craziness to the villa without being totally hatable so I think the public will keep them around as long as they keep feeding the drama.

I thought the guys could have done something a little shocking and dumped Catherine, although I think they made the right choice. As much as I like older representation, Charlotte seemed to be on a totally different wavelength and that doesn't work when most of the cast is young and not really at the stage to start looking for a family.

I'm surprised that Sammy seems to be into Jess? I was thinking he was using her but who knows if he's just saying what she wants to hear.

I think the public did a good job with the voting - glad to see Zach and Sammy down in the bottom 3. Team chaos!",8,t3_14b80ks,1687519843,0.4332

They both seem like nice girls, but I think for bombshells you need someone a bit more fiery to shake things up. I find that when bombshells come in and they're trying to be nice, do things by the book and not step on toes they don't do as well. 

Charlotte was just on a totally different wavelength than everyone else, and Leah seems super nice but a little dry (at least on reality TV.) Scott is attractive but again, doesn't have that 'i'm going to get what I want' vibe which is why he's not really making as much of a splash. Obviously that's nice in the real world but makes it hard to shake things up now that people are more in their comfort zone with their couple at this stage.",25,t3_14b80ks,1687519843,0.9493

- Is masturbation outright forbidden by production? Or is having 2 toilets going to be a natural barrier for that?
- Do girls get their period whilst on the show? I know that BC pills can prevent periods, but from my understanding it's not a guarantee and depends on the type of pill being used?
- Holiday squits are pretty common, is it common for islanders to have some ""explosive"" sessions in the toilet (which there are only two of üò¨)?
- What is the actual stance on sexual activity?

There seems to be a lot of sexual and social pedestalising within the villa.

Easy examples:

‚Ä¢ **The tallest guy is with the shortest girl in the villa - Zack and Molly**

‚Ä¢ **Funniest guys either get immediately friendzoned or pedestalised - no in-between. George immediately friendzoned, and then now Mitch**

‚Ä¢ **Most if not all of the guys the girls have been with have been pedestalised or made to be at the centre of attention:**

First - Mitch, by Molly, Jess and the rest of the girls (now friendzoned) 

Second - Zack, by Katherine, Molly, Leah, and Charlotte 

Third - Tyriech, by Ella, Jess, Leah 

Fourth - Sammy, by Leah, and Jess

Sami should of told Leah the night before that he was feeling Jess and that‚Äôs on him, but with the quick re couple he didn‚Äôt get a chance to get his conversation with her. Did he act disrespectful, yes, but he was frustrated that people were saying things behind his back to Jess and Leah, and him losing his cool and starting to talk crazy did not help. I think he had the right idea, but executed poorly, honestly girls like Ella butting in and sparking drama before anyone in the situation can talk about it directly, is not cool.

But then there was the terrace moment? After she's been saying how there's not the attraction yet and things are hard with him? Doesn't make sense. Weird relationship, me no likey.
* Mitch is so crazy ahahah but I kind of love it because everyone clocks it. Jess's face when he was saying how ""It should be me"" would literally be me. I think everyone is realizing he's a bit strange but not really malicious. Definitely an interesting islander haha
* Tea that Molly was like ""oh yeah we're not closed off"" and then Zach claiming to be closed off. Will Molly be closed off with anyone? haha still early days but I think it says something about how she is definitely not ready to stick with Zach. Girl does not want to be committed.
* Sammy sucks - glad Jess realizes it. Tomorrow seems like it will be the end of them.
* I like Scott as he seems like a relatively nice and normal dude, but I won't be surprised if he chooses Leah over Catherine. I like both girls so we'll see how that shapes up.

what did Molly do wrong that she is branded game player and untrustworthy ?

correct me if I'm wrong, Molly was coupled up with Mitch by the public, once she realized he is a creep she directed her attention to Zach and they finally coupled up the other day

1. Sammy is a slimeball with a majorly outsized ego and clearly feels aggrieved that in his own mind he's out of Jess' league and she isn't acting grateful enough to be with him. He loved having two girls to choose between and now he's panicking because Jess isn't as much of a melt for him as he expected.

2. Jess is a drama llama who looks for any reason to pick a fight. His reaction to her getting to know Mitch in that conversation was actually totally normal - he said she could get to know him and that was fine, he just wouldn't wait around forever, which is what they all say. He also had a point that if he acted like he didn't care at all she'd be mad too. I don't think he could have had any reaction that she wouldn't have kicked off about.

Overall they're both exhausting at this point and I'm glad they can't recouple. Hopefully Sammy is gone next dumping, I found their turbulence entertaining but it's run its course and the way he talks about/to women is gross.",52,t3_14ez5sy,1687528563,-0.7338

Mehdi and Whitney I love, they are growing on me. Whitney is also gorgeous, she looks like Naomi Campbell.

Love molly and zak together, finally. Molly is a bad bitch for the way she dealt with psycho Mitch lol. Jess was annoying with her jealous comments but she‚Äôs harmless overall. Zak is so fucking fine my GODDDDDDDDD. Wow. He‚Äôs def better looking than molly to me personally. 

Mitch‚Ä¶ yeah psycho. Waiting for him to be dumped.

Jess and Sammy i was rooting for them‚Ä¶ now idk what i think and don‚Äôt want to form an opinion until i see this new upcoming drama.

Leah is a cute girl, curious to see if her and Scott go anywhere. Scott seems more interested in her than Catherine based on the sexual tension comments he made, and him stating he‚Äôs leaning more towards Leah when Catherine asked. Scott is gorgeous. Leah is super super sweet and endearing. Catherine is super mature and beautiful. I love her personality. Love the way she handles thing, very mature just like Molly.

Ty and Ella, Ella‚Äôs body is just wow! Ty is one of the hottest guys ever to be in the villa along with Zakeriah. Top two hottest this season for sure. Ella was so annoying when he was getting to know Leah, sorry but she was too much. I do find their bickering funny and cute sometimes though. Overall i like them together. I just don‚Äôt know if Ty would behave not just in casa amor but outside of the show‚Ä¶ he seems like a huge player and flirt for sure. But u rly can‚Äôt be mad at him with that face. My God he‚Äôs beautiful. 

I rly liked ruche. Sad she left. She‚Äôs gorg and i love her vibe. Charolette was nice but she didn‚Äôt fit into love island vibes, she needs someone much more mature. Andre was cool, i wanted him to stay for Catherine bc i feel like he was the only one that was ride or die for Catherine. The fact he wanted her the second she was available again even though he started something with ruche. I felt bad for ruche but it showed how much he rly felt towards Catherine. :/ 

George was almost non existent obv as first to go and barely any screen time or connections made but he wasn‚Äôt as bad as i thought he would be, just a little awkward sometimes. Shame about those rumors about him bc he‚Äôs good looking if u look past the cringe comments he makes sometimes but he took me by surprise in his after sun interview. He wasn‚Äôt as awkward during that. Very well spoken.",2,t3_14ez5sy,1687528563,0.9994

* Generally I'm team Jess bc I think Sammy is bad vibes, but I think she is doing a poor job of articulating herself. I think she is seeing through him and his clocking his defensiveness but she is calling him on more vague stuff about ""wanting to get to know Mitch"" - I don't see them lasting at all and my take is that Sammy never really liked Jess like that, but coupled with her out of convenience, but now he's mad that she has options. He wants to be a prize. 
* Mehdi and Whitney - my take is that they both like each other in a kind of friendship 'lol' way but Idk if there is true romantic passion. Everything is jokes (unless Mehdi has a random freakout for no reason) But I don't think they're totally fake- like I think they each want it to work but aren't exactly that into each other physically and personality-wise. Idk we'll see.
* Save Mitch at all costs. Mans is reality TV gold - I'm also enjoying him more because he's simmered down a bit and hasn't been showing his full blown crazy side

They both seem chill and reasonable, gave each other space, and then confirmed their attraction to each other. Good vibes! Who knows if it will last but idk it's the first couple I'm really rooting for this season. I thought Montel and Catherine also had good chemistry. Honestly Scott and Montel are my fave guys as far as who I'd go for if I was in that fish bowl.
* Sammy sucks - I'm definitely team Jess in their argument but I think that Jess does a poor job of articulating herself. I think she recognizes that Sammy's defensiveness and alarming ability to make girls cry are red flags but she reverts back to the 'talking to other people' thing instead of calling out the communication. But at the same time, I think she does still kind of like him and wants it to work so she's not ready to burn the bridge yet.
* I feel bad for Leah but I kind of see why people aren't picking her. I think she's a catch and someone else in this thread mentioned she's really good at first dates but then after there's awkwardness and she doesn't give a lot of light-hearted banter. Everything is more serious and straightforward which I think makes it difficult to the guys to relate and vibe with her. Even Montel was asking about her 'real personality' so I think it's coming across to them that although she's stunning, smart, has a head on her shoulders, she's missing that levity and banter that they may be looking for. She just seems reserved and closed off. Still, I'm rooting for Montel and Leah as their first date was the first time on this show that I saw an initial vibe.
* I hope some serious drama comes from the Zach cheating issues next episode - I need something to shake up that couple because I think they're just together out of convenience/lust and not because they're really compatible long term
* LMAO Mitch - my delusional king. Now don't kill me, but I think generally the islanders clock his weirdness and I think he's mellowed out now that he understands his situation in the villa. I think he and the others can banter more since it's like they're all in on it. Idk I felt like there was a smidge of self-awareness with the Jess/Mitch convo. Like he's still light-hearted with his delusions. I think if he plays his cards right he can be kooky-crazy but likable, and not just a total psycho as he came off in the first 2 weeks.",41,t3_14fjnuj,1687518529,0.9843

Time and time again during show I‚Äôve seen on social media that whenever a white man is coupled up with a black woman people are always so confused as to what that guy could‚Äôve seen with his partner to make him attracted to her. 

Sammy is arguing that he didn‚Äôt see the physical attraction between Scott and Catharine and Whitney and Mehdi. Wasn‚Äôt Catharine the first person Scott pulled aside when he got into the villa? Do we not see them cuddling all the time? Didn‚Äôt Whitney and mehdi just have their first kiss in the episode prior? 
In my opinion I don‚Äôt think Sammy is accepting of an interracial couple. 

It‚Äôs just so sad that when it comes to the black girls on this show, their physical appearance is degraded to the point where people are shocked that a white guy could be attracted to them and this is such sad thing to witness. Just going on the love island into the alone under Scott‚Äôs bombshell pic I saw so many comments saying stuff like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs going to Catherine when Leah and Molly are right there‚Äù‚Ä¶ why are comments like this so common???

What really got me was when Catherine was trying to get her point across about how his opinion on the physical attraction comment really affected her and he didn‚Äôt give her any time to talk which let her cry out of frustration.

If you don't like someone that everyone else does and you don't get the hype just say so, or if you changed your mind throughout the season that's ok. We all watch the show with our own eyes and minds to form our own opinions. It's fair to dislike them for how they've acted in situations or their personality in general but to use their fanbase's ""worship"" of them or their ott theories of ""everyone is against them"" as a reason of why you're ""starting"" to dislike them is silly to me when they have no connection to their fans while they're in the villa.

It's different if they come out being shady and encouraging their fans to be nasty to others but until then say who you don't like and why with your full chest. I know some people don't like to voice unpopular opinions because of the backlash and downvoting but it is supposed to be freedom of speech so we shouldn't be afraid to have our say even if it goes against the grain. And if people don't wanna have healthy debates of disagreement and just wanna be rude I suggest blocking or deleting the comment/post if people refuse to be civil and can't give an actual pov without insults, don't bother fighting back and forth giving yourself a headache like these strangers on a tv show are paying you.

Just a thought...I've been seeing some people complaining about fanbases and it bought me back to S8 and how I too was sucked into the illusion of the fans are the reason I don't like them when the truth was I didn't like them anyway.

No reaction is the best reaction. It really rubbed me the wrong way when he said 'Leah speaks well'. Does Leah speak at all? And it's very obvious Whitney masks her feelings and nerves with humour.

The girls were in the wrong for attacking Zach but Molly should be concerned about his 'I can't wait to find a girl I don't want to cheat on' comment. He can just choose to be single?

Tyrique has become my favourite islander. The way he respectfully told Ella she was wrong but still had her back in public put him in my good books! I think they'll last for a very long time after the show.

How do the islanders stomach Mitch's presence? He always has an opinion but was calling out Ella for beign too 'opinionated'? Jess was as equally responsible yet he said nothing to her because she's his ticket to stay in the villa.

I feel bad for Leah, just used as practise for flirting by these boys.

Molly gets too much hate. People complain about her 'doing too much' but it's literally the personality of every theatre kid. And if she was trying to act more cool, she would still get hate for 'putting on an act'?

You can tell Jess has no interest in Mitch and only likes Sammy, hence the crying when seeing him with Mal. She clearly only spoke to Mitch to put Sammy on his toes and it backfired horribly.

Lamest thing she could do is pick Sammy or Montel, because no one will really care if Mal or Leah have to leave. Mitch is a nice middle ground in terms of ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù factor, because it would be a blow to see Jess leave, but she‚Äôs nowhere near as loved as, say, Ella.",2,t3_14gstlo,1687684713,-0.7597

I can't help thinking about the first weeks and how much hate she received when people believed she was a producer plant and getting the most airtime. It will be so unpleasant to see people come for her even more savage if they see this as favouritism as Kady will have told the producers she was choosing Zach therefore people may accuse the show of only putting the twist in because it's Molly but wouldn't have done it for someone else. Even though there would be no way to prove that it's true, people's mixed feelings of Molly could bring more hate towards her and make people think that her storyline going forward is predetermined.

Even though this has been done before in other versions I'm not sure if they were a person that the public had preconceived ideas about and judged as harshly as a ""producer plant or favourite"" as Molly was. Selfishly I want her to come back because her relationship with Zach is most intriguing to me to see play out however I'd understand her not returning as the viewers hate has gotten more worse over the years and could impact her mental health more if there's a huge backlash.

I think people will get over her not being there eventually more than her being there.

That comment gave me war flashbacks to myself at 21 when I dated a 26yr who explicitly told me he broke up with his gf of *six* years by cheating on her first and then telling her he was moving for a nonexistent job (like Chandler on Friends pretending to move to YemenüíÄ). There I was all ‚Äúüòäthat‚Äôs okay because he was honest which means he‚Äôs grown from it and he won‚Äôt do that to *me*. He makes me feel so calm and safe and like I‚Äôve known him my entire life.‚Äù You can guess how that ended lmaoooo

Then really if you think of this past week Zach said his head couldn‚Äôt be turned in that game, reiterated to her he hoped it couldn‚Äôt be turned in their discussion about said game, went on a date and Molly talked about being more and more closed and him reassuring that. Her telling him he‚Äôs her safe space and him *loving* that, only for him to proclaim Kady is *his type* to the boys and then come to her after he‚Äôs talked to Kady once and say essentially ‚Äúyeah if anyone comes in you should get to know them for sure‚Äù and her proclaiming they‚Äôre still on the same pageüò¨

Originally I thought bringing Molly back would be fun and someone mentioned doing it in the heart race challenge which sounded epic!

Then I saw this post

And now I‚Äôm fully in the Molly should not return crowd. If she comes back I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to go well for her and we will all have to witness her learning for the first time the life lesson Danica reminded us of last season of ‚Äúall men are trash‚Äù that every girl goes through at some point in their life, which feels cruel to watch? At least with her leaving it‚Äôs a mercy kill and she can learn it while crying with her mom instead of on our TVs?

I like drama but I‚Äôm not that cruel and heartless omg

I expect we see Zach‚Äôs second Villian Arc beginning Sunday (or I guess he could surprise us and pine after Molly because now she‚Äôs forbidden fruit from being eliminated, but I think it‚Äôs most likely the former).",19,t3_14hrpnq,1687684695,-0.7113

The format of ""bombshell picks, third wheel immediately goes home"" should definitely still have happened this season, but to an OG islander _not_ in a real couple",1,t3_14hrpnq,1687684695,0.6124
